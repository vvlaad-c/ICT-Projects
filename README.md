## 2a Coding Challange
#### How to use the code
The arrays in the program don't have any values stored in them
so if you actually want to see output from the code, you should add some
test values to the array

#### Code Walkthrough
I tried to make my program as modular as possible so that the code can
be reused in future projects if needed. I wrote a function for every major
task the program had to complete. I also used the pyinputplus module to 
be able to validate input in just a single line of code instead of 
writing multiple lines to validate the code. If you need to install the pyinput plus 
module to command is pip install pyinputplus.
